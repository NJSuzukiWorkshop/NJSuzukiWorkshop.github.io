      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>
      <p>Immerse yourself in a weekend of music-making with Suzuki students and teachers! The Suzuki Workshop includes a core curriculum for pianists, cellists, violists, and violinists in Suzuki Books 1–6, a Pre-Twinkle violin class, and the Every Child Can!&copy; course for teachers and parents. We’ll kick off the weekend with a play-in on Friday evening, offer master classes, group classes, and enrichment classes with our renowned clinicians throughout the weekend, and end on Sunday with a concert for all participants. Summer is a perfect time of the year for musical motivation! Come enjoy a quality Suzuki weekend in your own backyard. Make new friends while sharing the joy of making music!</p>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>Students participating in the full workshop must have polished their Twinkles. Participants will be placed in master classes and group classes according to age and repertoire. As with any Suzuki workshop, festival, or institute, repertoire must be played from memory, and parents or caregivers are required to attend classes.</p>
      <h3>Schedule</h3>
      <p>Each student’s schedule includes one master class, four group classes, and two enrichment classes with our guest clinicians. Participants have the option to sign up for an additional master class (additional $40 tuition fee). Violinists who have completed Humoresque have the option to sign up for the Viola for Violinist class ($40 tuition fee). Friday evening and Saturday will include Play-Ins. The workshop will conclude with a gala concert on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>To see the schedule, look <a href="../schedule/">here</a>, and for more information about the classes available, look <a href="../classes/">here</a>.

    <h1>Repertoire</h1>
    <div class="block"></div>
    <div class="row">
      <p>Pianists need to have a polished piece for their masterclass plus their ensemble piece. Book 1 students should review all of their working repertoire in Book 1.</p>
      <h3>Preparation for the Workshop</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Students should prepare a polished piece to play for the master class. Often a good guideline is a piece four pieces behind the one on which they are currently working. The home teacher should designate this piece before the student leaves for the workshop, and the piece must be in the Suzuki repertoire. The more polished the piece, the more the student will gain from the masterclass.</li>
        <li>Review the repertoire listed in the brochure regularly prior to the workshop.</li>
        <li>Parents should take careful notes at the workshop. Take notes not only of your child’s lesson, but other good ideas you discover in the other lessons given in the master class and the group classes. Every moment of instruction, active or observed, is an opportunity to take home ideas and inspiration! Cameras are also helpful tools for specific posture elements and for videotaping short clips of an activity that will refine a skill your child is working on. After the workshop, share your notes or thoughts of the workshop with your home teacher for feedback and follow-through.</li>
        <li>The student may be asked to do something differently at the Institute—this is a good thing! Come with an open mind for new ideas and approaches.</li>
        <li>Make sure the students arrive with proper equipment:
          <ul>
            <li>CD and player or iPod to listen to their piece</li>
            <li>Suzuki Books</li>
            <li>Metronome and Tuner</li>
            <li>Rosin</li>
            <li>A properly prepared instrument. Put on new strings, consider getting the bow rehaired if necessary. Check over your equipment!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ask your teacher beforehand whether the student is ready for a new instrument or not. If a workshop teacher or luthier offers advice in this area, make sure you mention it to your home teacher after the workshop.</li>
      </ul>
