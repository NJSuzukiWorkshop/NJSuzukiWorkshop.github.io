          <h3>Masterclass</h3>
          <p>A master class lesson is a shared experience. Three or four children, depending on their age and repertoire, are assigned to a teacher for an hour. During this hour, the teacher will teach each of the students individually while the others watch. By watching the other students, your child will be motivated and will learn much about playing the instrument. Parents attend the entire hour to observe and take notes of interest from all of the students' lessons. Please prepare a polished piece to play in the masterclass. This means something you can already play easily so that you can gain the most from the teacher’s comments. Students may add an optional second masterclass into their schedule.</p>

On Sunday, stay for the Concert.</p>
