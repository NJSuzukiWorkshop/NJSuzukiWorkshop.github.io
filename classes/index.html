          <h3>Masterclass</h3>
          <p>A master class lesson is a shared experience. Three or four children, depending on their age and repertoire, are assigned to a teacher for an hour. During this hour, the teacher will teach each of the students individually while the others watch. By watching the other students, your child will be motivated and will learn much about playing the instrument. Parents attend the entire hour to observe and take notes of interest from all of the students' lessons. Please prepare a polished piece to play in the masterclass. This means something you can already play easily so that you can gain the most from the teacher’s comments.</p>

          <h3>Violin, Viola, and Cello Group Classes</h3>
          <p>These classes are organized by book level. In a group repertoire class, musical techniques and playing skills can be worked on as the students play their common repertoire together.</p>

          <p>Sunday afternoon only.

Children attend with a parent or guardian. Children will enjoy musical games with experienced Suzuki teachers and both parent and child will learn plenty of fun practice techniques to take home. After the class, stay for the Concert.</p>
          <p>Recommended for ages 4-6 (3&apos;s with recommendation of teacher).</p>
