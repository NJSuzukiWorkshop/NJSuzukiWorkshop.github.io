          <h3>Masterclass</h3>
          <p>A master class lesson is a shared experience. Three or four children, depending on their age and repertoire, are assigned to a teacher for an hour. During this hour, the teacher will teach each of the students individually while the others watch. By watching the other students, your child will be motivated and will learn much about playing the instrument. Parents attend the entire hour to observe and take notes of interest from all of the students' lessons. Please prepare a polished piece to play in the masterclass. This means something you can already play easily so that you can gain the most from the teacher’s comments.</p>

          <p>These classes are organized by book level. In a group repertoire class, musical techniques and playing skills can be worked on as the students play their common repertoire together.</p>

          <p>On Saturday, July 7, we will offer a Pre-Twinkle class for beginner violinists (those who have not yet mastered Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star and variations). Students must already have a private Suzuki violin teacher. Movement, posture, rhythm, and singing activities will be used to enhance foundational skills. Students who enroll in the Pre-Twinkle Class will also have the opportunity to participate in one enrichment class on Saturday.</p>
